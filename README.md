## OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS

Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this project, I used  various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
___

### FINANCIAL INFORMATION

I used a historical dataset that includes the following:
* Loan Size
* Interest Rate
* Borrower Income
* Debt to Income
* Number of Accounts 
* Derogatory Marks
* Total Debt
* Loan Status

___

### WHAT THE MODEL IS PREDICTING

The model is created to predict the healthy loans versus the high risk loans to better identify the credit worthiness of customers.

___

### STAGES OF MACHINE LEARNING:

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

### Created a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

### Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data 


* I used a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset. First, I used the original dataset. Second, I resampled the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.

 * For both cases, I got the count of the target classes, trained a logistic regression classifier, calculated the balanced accuracy score, generated a confusion matrix, and lastly, generated a classification report.

### RESULTS

### Machine Learning Model 1: Classification Report using Original Data

  * The Balanced Accuracy Score is 94.8%, which means it detected true positives versus true negatives at 94.8% accuracy rate.
  * The precision score for '0' (healthy loans) is a perfect 1.0, recall is .99 and F1, another perfect score of 1.0 . As for the '1' (high-risk loans) precision score is .85, recall score of .90 and F1 score of .87. This shows that the model performed better at predicting the healthy loans.
  

### Machine Learning Model 2 :Classification Report using Oversampled Data

  * The Balanced Accuracy Score is 99.4 %, which means it detected true positives versus true negatives at 99.4% accuracy rate.
  * The precision score for '0' (healthy loans) is a perfect 1.0, recall is .99 and F1, another perfect score of 1.0 . As for the '1' (high-risk loans) precision score is .85, recall score of 1.0 and F1 score of .99. This shows that this model also performed better at predicting the healthy loans.

### SUMMARY

The results regarding the accuracy of the prediction for healthy loans vs high risk loans is better with the oversampled data. The accuracy score results for the model fit with oversampled data is 99.46% versus 94.8% with the model fit with the original data. This means that the former is better at detecting true positives and true negatives.

The precision score for the minority class is the same at .85

The recall score for the for the minority with the original data is lower at .90 versus 1.0 with the resampled data. Meaning that the model with the oversampled data is better at detecting high-risk loans and credit worthiness of the borrowers.

I highly recommend using the model fit with oversampled data.

## Technologies

This project is written in Python with the following packages:

* imbalanced-learn
* PyDotPlus
* Numpy
* Pandas

---

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install and verify the following dependencies:

* Pandas from PyPI
```python
pip install pandas
```
* Numpy from PyPI
```python
pip install numpy
```

*  Imbalanced Learn using Conda. Best practice, use an environment rather than install in the base env

```python
conda activate dev
conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn
conda list imbalanced-learn
```

*  PyDotPlus using Conda. Best practice, use an environment rather than install in the base env

```python
conda activate dev
conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus
conda list pydotplus
``` 

Next, Import the Modules

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from imblearn.metrics import classification_report_imbalanced

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```
