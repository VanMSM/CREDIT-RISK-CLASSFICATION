# CREDIT RISK CLASSFICATION

A SUPERVISED LEARNING PROJECT

## Background

Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this projecct, I used  various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Using imbalanced-learn library, I used a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset. First, I used the original dataset. Second, I resampled the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.

For both cases, I got the count of the target classes, trained a logistic regression classifier, calculated the balanced accuracy score, generated a confusion matrix, and lastly, generated a classification report.
